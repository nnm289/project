            <p>Raheem Sterling: "I've always thought: 'You know, maybe one day I'd love to play abroad and see how I
                would come up against that challenge.'"; Sterling has struggled for game time at Manchester City since
                the spring and has started only two Premier League games this season</p>

margin-bottom: 20px;">
            <p>Despite playing a starring role for England during this summer's Euro 2020 tournament, the 26-year-old
                has struggled to hold down a regular place in Pep Guardiola's side this calendar year.

                After scoring 30 goals in 51 appearances during the 2019-20 campaign, the forward only managed to find
                the net 14 times last term and has started just twice in this season's Premier League.

            </p>
            <p style="margin-top: 20px;">Speaking at the FT Business of Sport US summit, Sterling said: "If there was an
                opportunity to go somewhere else, (for more game time), I would be open to it at this moment in time.
            </p>
